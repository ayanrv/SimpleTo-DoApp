# SimpleTo-DoApp

---Overview

The To-Do List App is a user-friendly application designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. It provides features such as adding tasks, sorting tasks alphabetically in both ascending (A-Z) and descending (Z-A) orders, and displaying notifications for duplicate tasks. The app also leverages local storage to save tasks between sessions.



---Key Features

-Task Management: Users can add tasks to their to-do list and remove them when completed.

-Sorting: Users can sort tasks alphabetically either from A to Z or from Z to A, allowing for better organization of tasks.

-Duplicate Task Notification: The app prevents the addition of duplicate tasks by notifying the user if a task already exists in the list.

-Persistent Storage: Tasks are saved to the browser's local storage, enabling the app to retain the to-do list even after the user closes and reopens the browser.



---Skills Applied

--JavaScript:

-DOM Manipulation: Managing dynamic updates to the DOM, such as adding and removing tasks from the list and updating the display when tasks are sorted.

-Event Handling: Responding to user actions like adding, deleting, and sorting tasks using event listeners.

-Local Storage: Using the browser's local storage API to save and retrieve tasks, providing data persistence across browser sessions.



--Data Structures:

-Arrays: Storing tasks in arrays and sorting them based on the user's preference.



--Control Flow:

-Conditional Statements: Checking for duplicate tasks and managing task additions and deletions based on user input.



--UX Design:

-User Notifications: Enhancing the user experience by providing clear notifications when duplicate tasks are added.

-Responsive UI: Designing a user interface that is easy to navigate and interact with.
